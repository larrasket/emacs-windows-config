#+title: Emacs Configuration For Windows


In 2022, and for purely capitalists reasons, I had to use MS Windows. The breif story is
that the Mono project did not implement all the cryptography libraries to be used on Linux,
and I couldn't convice my team to migrate to .NET 6. So I exported all my unix-like configs
to Windowsw, includes a lot of other utilities. I considerd publishing this configuration
for public because it was a quite hard job to get this Emacs distribution to work, I'd to go
through a lot of problems with envs, PATH, and Windows binaries. However, I don't have the
time to clean nor document it. Hopefully it would help someone, somehow. Even if it was just me.

I decided to add all my emacs configuration in this repo, alongside with the Windows
configuration, the main configuration can be found under [[file:etc/][/etc/]].
